# Book_Store

Challenge
Mr Czesław from the STX BookStore company asked you for help with writing an application that will allow him to browse the list of books and help him understand what needs to be ordered for his bookstores.

The application must be a REST API. It needs to allow for some basic operations, such as:
    • getting the list of books from the database
    • adding a new book
    • editing an existing book
    • removing the book from the database

When it comes to getting the list of books, Mr Czesław wants to be able to filter the results by title, author, publication year (where the range of years is given) and by the acquired state (if the book is already acquired or not). 

Mr Czesław would like to have the option to import books into his database using the publicly available Google API:
    • https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes (usage example: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=Hobbit )

Mr Czesław wants to be able to import books by a given author via API. In response, he wants to see the number of imported books.

    • Take care of good coding practices (PEP8, code organization, etc.)

When submitting the task, please provide us with:
    • URL for the deployed application
    • link to the public repository, so that our technical recruiters can look at the code.
